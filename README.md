**UML Model Extractor**

This repository contains XML model files and a Python script designed to parse and extract information from UML class diagrams. The main components include:

`model.xml`: Sample XML files representing UML class diagrams in XMI format. These files can be used to demonstrate feature extraction, visualization, or analysis of class structures, attributes, operations, and relationships.

`extractor.py`: A Python script that parses the XML files, extracts class details such as names, attributes, data types, and operations, and outputs the information in a structured format.

**Features:**
Parses complex UML class diagrams with multiple classes, attributes, operations, and associations.
Handles XML namespaces to ensure compatibility with various XMI-based UML models.
Outputs extracted data in a readable format for further analysis or documentation purposes.

**Usage:**
Place your XMI-format UML files (e.g., `model.xml`) in the repository.
Run `extractor.py` to parse the UML model and extract class information.
View the output in the terminal or extend the script to write the results to a file.

**Prerequisites:**
Python 3.6 or higher.
`xml.etree.ElementTree` (built-in XML parsing library in Python).
Feel free to contribute by adding more sample UML models or improving the parsing capabilities!
